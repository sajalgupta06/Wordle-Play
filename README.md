# A Wordle Clone built in React

Unsurprisingly, this project is inspired by (and a remake of) popular word game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

## Game Play

Once the game is loaded (playable [here](http://wordle.electric-bungalow.com)), you can begin typing your first guess.  When you are ready, press enter.  You may use your computer's keyboard or the on-screen keyboard.

The on-screen keyboard's background colors will update to correspond with the results of the guess.  Unlike the original game, once a word is either successfully guessed, or failed after 6 tries, you can press Enter to get a new word.

For the general rules of Wordle, check the original site linked above.
